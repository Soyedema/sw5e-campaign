# sw5e-campaign

My project is a webpage for a custom dungeons and dragons campaign. The purpose of the website is to provide players with the information they need to run the game. 

The features i have implemented from the list are:
  *Hamburger menu
  *Javascript math function, with results being displayed on the site
  *Use of Bootstrap
  *Media Queries for two-column layout
  
There are no special instructions to run this site. It should work on all devices. On devices with width of 400px or less, the layout looks worse, but is still functional.
