# sw5e-campaign

My project is a webpage for a custom dungeons and dragons campaign set in the Star Wars Universe. The purpose of the website is to provide players with the information they need to run the game. 

The features i have implemented from the list are:
  *Hamburger menu
  *Javascript math function, with results being displayed on the site
  *Use of Bootstrap
  *Media Queries for two-column layout
  
There are no special instructions to run this site. 

To view project on mobile devices go to "https://soyedema.github.io/sw5e-campaign/" in your web browser. Webpage works on my iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 13.5.1. I do not have an android device to test the page on.

One thing to note is that the additional webpages are not completed. The HTML files for the links "DMs", "Players", and "Modules" do exist and they do take you to the proper destination. However, those destinations are a blank white page with no content, as those pages are currently place holders while I work on the content. Those pages will require features (such as downloading files, uploading files, logging in, making an account) that I currently do not have the ability to program. However, the links were still included so that the navigation bar functioned, and so that I could test out making a hamburger menu.
