            <p>So, when does this all take place? Well the campaign starts in the year 799 BBY (Before Battle of Yavin). For context, the Jedi Sith War would have ended in the year 1022 BBY and the Galactic Republic as we know it would have been formed in the year 1019 BBY. This puts our story after the Old Republic but well before the events of Episode One.</p>
            <p>There is not much official official information about this time period in the Star Wars universe, however, we are able to make a few safe assumptions. First, with the Jedi Sith war ending 223 years ago, it is safe to assume that the Galactic Republic is still recovering from the previous conflict, which lasted hundreds of years. Although they have had time to build their strength and become a superpower in the universe, they are not yet as strong as they are during the Clone Wars. That is where the name Republic Renaissance comes from. The Republic is in a stage of expansion, hoping to add more worlds to the senate, and reclaim some of it's former glory.</p>
            <p>Another thing we know about this time is that the Sith are a shadow of their formerselves. At the end of the war, Darth Bane enacted the Rule of Two. This meant that at any time there could only be two sith, a master and an apprentice. However, at their height, the Sith Empire controlled a large portion of the galaxy. For this reason, this campaigns works under the assumption that there are a significant number of Sith cultist remaining who still practice the old ways of the Sith (and who can be used as canon fodder for your mighty party of adventurers).</p>

            <p>With all of this known, who are the major players in the galaxy? Well the Galactic Republic is a strong contender for strongest in the galaxy, but are certainly not the only ones vying for control. Below are some other factions currently making an impact in the galaxy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Mandolorians </b>- At this time the Mandolorians are in a bit of a conquest in their surrounding systems. Still clinging to their old ways of war, the mandolorians are waging war in the outer Rim territories. Currently, they are not at war with the Republic, having signed a peace treaty 10 years prior. However, few in the republic expect this peace to last.</li>
                <li><b>The Hutts</b> - As expected, the Hutts are taking advantage of a weakened Republic. Nearly uncontested, the Hutt pirate ships harrass popular hyperspace lanes, disrupting trade and profiting off the work of others. Of course they are still quite active in the bounty hunting market, employing the majority of bounty hunters in the galaxy. Currently, the Republic has declared war against The Hutt Empire and fight them regularly.</li>
                <li><b>The Pikes</b> - During the times of the Clone Wars, this species/pirate organization will have full control over the Kessel Run, allowing them almost total control of spice trade in the galaxy. Currently they are growing in strength seem to have a knack for finding old relics which would have been better unfound.</li>
            </ul>
